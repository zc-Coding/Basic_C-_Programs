### C# Projects
These are some small C# programs I made to learn the basic functionality of the language along with the .NET Framework. 
They are from exercises I did at The Tech Academy bootcamp. They are names after the concept that was used in the code.

#### TwentyOne:
This is a C# counsole app made in the MVC model style. It has logic to play a twenty one game casino style including placing bets,
and removing cheaters if certain exceptions are thrown. The classes and logic are set-up to add more games using the game and player controllers.
There is also data logging attached to the program that records players with a special indentity code, datetime and what card was dealt.

#### PackageExpress:
This is a cnosole with some basic math logic applied to a users input. it takes in package size and weight and return a quote or a message,
that the packaged cannot be shipped by this company.
